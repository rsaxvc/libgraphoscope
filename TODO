todo:rendering engine

This is an extension of the traveling salesman problem. The scope
will draw tiny traces between graphics primitives, so we need to
keep the downtime as short as possible - to achieve this we want
to sort the draw order to minimize average distance between primitives.
Also, we can convert circles into a series of arcs to assist this.
